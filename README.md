# Well Hello There ðŸ‘‹

I am the original maker of this extension, if you find this Repo, it means what you are looking for the code of this extension, which tbh, you don't want to.

This chrome extension has been made about 4-5 years ago now, and it's completly outdated, someone better than me at the time you are reading this probably has made a better version of this, so please look somewhere else !

If for whatever reason you still need and want the source code, well, there you have it.

I will be rebuilding the code with blind knowledge of it working (or not) as I am no longer a 42 Student, and I don't have access to the 42 intranet website.

> I have litteraly NO idea if the bit that I am going to update will work but I will just remove useless bit here and there to make the code look clean with Es6 support and just better looking code, because f@ck me this sh#t looks nasty as hell.


Thanks for coming along, please take a look at my other repo if you've got the time.
